    '''The period succeeding the year 550 BCE approximates the beginning of mathematics in Greece and the age of philosophy. It also heralds the lives of figures such as Pygathoras, Plato, Euclid, and Archimedes, pioneering the introduction of the basic concepts of geometry, trigonometry, and astronomy through various works such as The Elements. In addition, the concept of Pygathoreanism was introduced to select individuals, creating a culture that highly glorified mathematics ⎯ treating it, in essence, as the predominant force in the universe ⎯ that became secluded and separated from the masses.

Just as math is new and unfamiliar during this period, human infancy is similarly secluded. The child has just been introduced to the world and is often held at high importance; they are frequently viewed as the center of the universe, by their parents due to the vanity of love, and by themselves because they lack the development necessary to differentiate themselves from their surroundings. Furthermore, infants often create standards and means of conveying their intentions that only their parents understand due to the child’s lack of verbal communication, similar to how those who practiced Pygathoreanism were highly secretive, and how mathematics was only available and understood by a handful of individuals.
